In order to authenticate speaker’s identity real time speech signal is compared with the pre-recorded user’s voice signals in the database. Here the sampled signal’s power spectrum density is compared with power spectrum density of the pre-recorded voice using MATLAB and on successful match the name of the particular speaker is displayed. The possible application of this project could to operate personalized digital gadgets with voice commands. Speaker Recognition - the ability of the computer to understand the spoken words for the purpose receiving commands and data input from the speaker."
